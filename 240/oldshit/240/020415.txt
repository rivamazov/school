this is a pointer to current object.
good idea to use it for class variables ie.
return this->numElements;
A*B*C use move to edit a value.

lab overload a[1]
this refers to a
a+b
see operator+ for &rhs example
when an overload is a member function have access to private data
when you return a reference dereference this (*this) and return it.

<< operator always comes before the object
as a result you do not have access to rhs private variables
shallow copy is a shared pointer
deep copy - sets up its own data array
if you do not declare copy constructor all it will do is share pointers.
